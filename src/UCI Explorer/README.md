# UCI Explorer Application

Windows Console application that will load a [UCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Chess_Interface) compliant chess engine and forward commands to it.

The Application expects to have an `Engine Binaries` directory located along side it. Place the engines you wish to use in this directory. Examples can be found here: http://kvetka.org/en/UCI_engines.shtml.
